This release includes files for generating models described in:
Maritan M, Autin L, Karr J, Covert M, Olson AJ, Goodsell DS (2021) Building Structure Models
of a Whole Mycoplasma Cell. J. Mol. Biol., in review.

Programs are written in Fortran, and include:
make_mRNA.f, make_segments.f, make_const.f, prot_const.f -- programs for preparing input files
circle_segments.f, relax_circle.f -- programs for creating model on non-plectonemic region
lattice.f -- program for creating lattice model of nucleic acids
relax.f -- program for relaxing nucleic acid model and adding spheres for proteins and ribosomes
More information is given in the header of each program.

DNA, RNA, polymerases, ribosomes, etc are specified by information from WholeCell models,
exported into custom csv files. Files for three timepoints are included in the release, along with
script files for the entire modeling pipeline for each, and a small proteins.dat file that 
specifies names and radii.
