MG_271_272_273_274_192MER,Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex composed by three subunits: E1-alpha (MG_274); E1-beta(MG_273); E2 (MG_272) and E3 (MG_271). In gram positive bacteria the 60-meric core (E2) exhibits icosahedral symmetry. Many structures of E2 from various organisms have been solved so far but none of them covered the entire E2 sequence. The missing domain of E2 structures is the N-term domain; an extremely flexible part of the enzyme; whose mobility is essential for the functioning of the whole enzyme complex. The N-term extends outwards from the 60-meric core and engages non-covalent binding with E1 and E3 subunits that decorate the outer shell of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Typically; a complex is made of 42-48 E1 tetramers; 6-12 E3 dimers and one 60-mer E2. Although; the stoichiometry of E1 and E3 is likely to vary from one complex to the other and also among different organisms. The overall complex is approximately 450A across; with an annular gap between the inner and the outer shell of approximately 70A. In the WC model; MG_271_272_273_274_192MER coordinates come from a cryoEM structure reconstruction (10.1093/emboj/cdf574; 10.1074/jbc.M504363200). The model comprises 60E2 and 60E3; although the interpretation of such model is that E3 monomers represent the two most likely location of a given E3 at any given time. Overall; the shape and the volume of this 3D model resemble the naive assembly of PDH.,
